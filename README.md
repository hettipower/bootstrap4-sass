For compile .scss files into one css `**grunt sass**`

We can also ask Grunt to watch for changes and run the tasks it needs. The watch task will run every time a file is changed and saved. Since the configuration was already set up on our Sass files we just need to simply type `**grunt watch**` on command prompt or terminal.
